# Google Books Search App

## Description

This is a React-based Google Books Search app. It has come to life by creating React components, working with helper/util functions, and utilizing React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I have also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later. Users can also delete books if they've read them.

Users can first see the Home page where they can search for amazing books by the courtesy of publicly available Google Books API.
Upon searching for a book, users get a list of relevant results. By clicking save, book is saved to the Saved page. In the back end, naturally, the book is being saved to the Mongo database. If a user has a wish to remove a saved book from the list, they may click the Delete button. Same operation is being done in the Mongo database, on the back end.
